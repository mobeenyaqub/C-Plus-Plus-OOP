This program has the ability to encrypt or decrypt files, as per the user request. The name of the file will be decided by the user, where encrypted data will be stored. For the sake of easy file encryption and decryption, temporary files named, "text.txt" and "decrypter.txt" will be created. The purpose of these files is to encrypt/decrypt the file and then transfer the encrypted/decrypted contents to the file created by the user. The temporary files will be removed, right after the program terminates.
