This program will ask the user to either login or sign up, as per the profiles made in the text file. If the user choose to login, they are required to enter their username, if the username is found, then the password will be asked and on correct entry of username and password, user will be logged in. In username is incorrect, user will be prompted to choose, either to try again with a different username or sign up. A username is unique and all the userdata is encrypted (both usernames and passwords). Neither the username, nor the password can have spaces, if the spaces are present, user will be prompted to try again. More over exception handling is also used for better data entry and catching errors, instead of crashing the program.
